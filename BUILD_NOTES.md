# Build Notes

Updated: 2026-06-20

This file is the machine-handoff checkpoint for `-wuci-ji`.

## Platform contract

`src/wuci-ji.s` is an x86_64 Linux program. It defines `_start` directly and uses
Linux syscall numbers, so it is not a macOS-native or arm64-native executable.

Native build and execution require:

- x86_64 Linux
- GNU-style `as` and `ld`
- Python 3 for the test harness

Cross-building from macOS or other non-Linux hosts currently uses Zig.

## Fresh-machine commands

On an x86_64 Linux machine:

```sh
make clean
make test
```

On macOS or another non-Linux machine with Zig installed:

```sh
make clean
make build-linux
file build/wuci-ji-linux-x86_64
```

`make build-linux` keeps `src/wuci-ji.s` in GNU `as` form and writes a generated
Zig/LLVM-compatible assembly copy to `build/wuci-ji.zig.s`.

On a Linux host with user-mode QEMU for x86_64:

```sh
make clean
make test-linux
```

If `qemu-x86_64` is not on `PATH`, pass it explicitly:

```sh
make test-linux QEMU_X86_64=/path/to/qemu-x86_64
```

## Test harness overrides

`tests/test_wuci_ji.py` can run a different binary or runner without editing the
test file:

```sh
WUCI_JI_BIN=/path/to/wuci-ji WUCI_JI_RUNNER=qemu-x86_64 python3 tests/test_wuci_ji.py
```

Leave `WUCI_JI_RUNNER` unset when running a native Linux binary directly.

## Current checkpoint

Observed host on 2026-06-20:

- Linux x86_64
- GNU `as` and `ld` are available.
- Python 3 is available.

Verified on this host:

- `make clean && make test` succeeds.
- `./build/wuci-ji selftest` succeeds as part of the Python test harness.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs the same native Linux x86_64 suite on
  Ubuntu with `make clean && make test`.

Fixes made while executing this checkpoint:

- The native object rule now assembles `$(SOURCE)` explicitly instead of using
  `$<`, because `check-native` is the first prerequisite.
- GNU `as` Intel-syntax `.set` length constants are loaded with
  `OFFSET FLAT:` so status and error writes use immediates rather than absolute
  memory reads.

The native build artifact is:

```text
build/wuci-ji: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
```

## Previous cross-build note

A previous Darwin arm64 checkpoint found that Zig could cross-build the x86_64
Linux ELF, but Homebrew `qemu` provided `qemu-system-x86_64` rather than Linux
user-mode `qemu-x86_64`, so that host could not run the ELF test suite directly.
After the Linux checkpoint restored GNU `OFFSET FLAT:` immediates for native
correctness, the Darwin cross-build path was adjusted to translate those
immediates only in the generated `build/wuci-ji.zig.s` source.

## Next pickup

1. Push the `seal`/`open` envelope commands and confirm the GitHub Actions run is
   green.
2. Add key/material zeroization for long-lived buffers after command completion.
3. Expand malformed-envelope tests if the envelope format grows beyond the
   current prefix, nonce, ciphertext, and tag layout.
